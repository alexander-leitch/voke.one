# Social Tech & Portraits Website

## Built with Google Antigravity

This project was collaboratively built using Google Antigravity, an advanced agentic coding assistant. The development process was driven by natural language prompts, allowing for rapid iteration and refinement.

### Prompt History

The following prompts were used to guide the creation and evolution of this project:

1.  **Initial Concept**: "Create a personal website for me. It needs to be a mix of 'Social Tech' and 'Portraits'. I want a landing page that shows off my tech side but also has a gallery of my portraits."
2.  **Image Customization**: "The images are still bad. Can I upload images to be used"
3.  **Debugging**: "I renamed them but the one image is broken now"
4.  **Project Restructuring**: "Please move the code to the root of the project."
5.  **Documentation**: "Please create a README.md file with details about how this project was created"

## Project Description

This project is a personal website combining a "Social Tech" aesthetic with a professional portrait gallery. It was created to showcase a dual persona: "The Professional" and "The Creative".

## Project Creation

This project was built using a modern, agentic workflow:

1.  **Conceptualization**: The core concept was defined as a "Social Tech" landing page featuring a dark mode aesthetic with neon accents, integrated with a high-quality portrait gallery.
2.  **Implementation**:
    -   **Structure**: Built with semantic HTML5 (`index.html`).
    -   **Styling**: Styled with Vanilla CSS (`styles.css`) focusing on a premium, responsive design with glassmorphism and smooth animations.
    -   **Assets**: High-quality portfolio images were selected and integrated into the gallery.
3.  **Refinement**:
    -   The project structure was optimized by moving the code to the root directory for easier access and deployment.
    -   Image assets were updated based on user feedback to ensure the highest visual quality.

## Project Structure

-   `index.html`: The main landing page containing the Hero, About, Skills, Gallery, and Contact sections.
-   `styles.css`: The stylesheet defining the "Social Tech" theme, animations, and responsive layout.
-   `images/`: Directory containing the project assets (backgrounds, portraits).

## Features

-   **Social Tech Aesthetic**: Dark theme, neon glow effects, and modern typography.
-   **Portrait Gallery**: A visual showcase of the user's professional and creative sides.
-   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   **Interactive Elements**: Smooth scrolling, fade-in animations, and hover effects.

## Usage

To view the website, simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build step is required.
