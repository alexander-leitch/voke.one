# Social Tech & Portraits Website

This project is a personal website combining a "Social Tech" aesthetic with a professional portrait gallery. It was created to showcase a dual persona: "The Professional" and "The Creative".

## Project Creation

This project was built using a modern, agentic workflow:

1.  **Conceptualization**: The core concept was defined as a "Social Tech" landing page featuring a dark mode aesthetic with neon accents, integrated with a high-quality portrait gallery.
2.  **Implementation**:
    -   **Structure**: Built with semantic HTML5 (`index.html`).
    -   **Styling**: Styled with Vanilla CSS (`styles.css`) focusing on a premium, responsive design with glassmorphism and smooth animations.
    -   **Assets**: High-quality portfolio images were selected and integrated into the gallery.
3.  **Refinement**:
    -   The project structure was optimized by moving the code to the root directory for easier access and deployment.
    -   Image assets were updated based on user feedback to ensure the highest visual quality.
