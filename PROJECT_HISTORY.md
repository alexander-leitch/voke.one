# Project History & Context

This document serves as a persistent history and context log for the "Social Tech & Portraits" website project. It is intended to help future AI assistants or developers pick up where the last session left off.

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Create a personal website combining a "Social Tech" aesthetic (dark mode, neon, glassmorphism) with a professional portrait gallery.
**Tech Stack**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS, No build tools required.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation & Aesthetic (Nov 2025)
-   **Initial Setup**: Created `index.html` and `styles.css`.
-   **Design System**: Established the "Social Tech" look using a dark background (`#0a0a0a`), neon accent colors (Cyan `#00f3ff`, Pink `#bc13fe`), and glassmorphism effects.
-   **Structure**: Implemented Hero, About, Skills, Gallery, and Contact sections.

### Phase 2: Content Integration
-   **Portrait Gallery**:
    -   Initially used placeholder images.
    -   User provided high-quality portfolio images.
    -   **Critical Fix**: Updated image paths to match user-uploaded files (`portrait-1.jpg`, `portrait-2.jpg`).
    -   **Layout**: 2-column grid with hover overlays for "The Professional" and "The Creative" personas.

### Phase 3: Refinement & Restructuring
-   **Project Move**: Moved all source files from `social-portrait-site/` subdirectory to the project root for simpler deployment.
-   **Documentation**: Created `README.md` with project details and prompt history.

## Current State
-   **Root Directory**: Contains `index.html`, `styles.css`, `README.md`, `PROJECT_HISTORY.md`, and `images/` folder.
-   **Functionality**: Fully responsive landing page with smooth scrolling and animations.
-   **Known Issues**: None.

## Next Steps / Future Ideas
-   **Verification**: Conduct a full cross-browser and device test.
-   **Performance**: Optimize image sizes for faster loading if needed.
-   **Expansion**: Consider adding a blog section or a detailed case study page.
-   **SEO**: Add meta tags and open graph data for better social sharing.

## Key Files
-   `index.html`: Main structure.
-   `styles.css`: All styling rules.
-   `images/`: Asset directory.
